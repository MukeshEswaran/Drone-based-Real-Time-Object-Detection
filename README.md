# Drone-based-Real-Time-Object-Detection

This project implements a real-time drone surveillance system that detects, tracks, and follows objects (e.g., cars) using a combination of YOLOv8, DeepSORT, and an ONNX-based re-identification (ReID) model. It allows users to select a target object from the screen, and the drone autonomously follows the selected object. This application is tailored for security, traffic monitoring, and urban surveillance use cases.
